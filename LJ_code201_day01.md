# LJ Code 201 - Day 1
It was very nice to meet all the classmates today. Getting to know everyone's background and why they want to learn coding has encouraged me to work hard in this class.
Sam went over class structure, goals, tips for succeeding, and computer setup.... although the today's lecture was long, it was still interesting. Looking forward to working with classmates in the future.
