Day 2
Today we learned about how to create a repo on GitHub, and learned some basic git commands on Terminal. I messed up a bit because my laptop already has some about_me and learning_journal files from last month. Aaron taught me how to delete a repo and he also guided me to solve the git conflict.
I am glad I spent some time to study how Git works before the class. It did help me alot to understand what's going on when Sam explained everything.
