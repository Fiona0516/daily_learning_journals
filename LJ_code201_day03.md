Day3
I realized code review is very helpful. There are some common mistakes I found I made when reviewing other classmate's code such as indentations and how to make the code itself more readable and consistent. Code review also reminded me to see other approaches that I did not remember to use yesterday.
Later we went over JS control flow by going back the the reading. It was also helpful to see different results when using == and ===.
