Day 4
I enjoyed the code review this morning. I learned how to clone somebody's work from Github to my own computer. Also, I was able to see how Lee used a for loop to solve the guessing number question since I was having difficulty to use a for loop and ended up writing a while loop.
The lecture about CSS layout was useful too. Sam gave us some extra resources to refer to. Will definitely take some time to read them.
