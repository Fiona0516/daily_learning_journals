Day 9
I was not able to get to class this morning but I worked on the form from yesterday. Goggled a lot and read the event chapter again. Finally figured something out but got stuck on a tiny piece where my new location is automatically added to a new row after the Total row. I tried calling the makeFooter function in different places, but nothing worked. I should probably get some help from a TA tomorrow.
