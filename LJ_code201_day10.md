I really like today's lab assignment. Making as nearly the same as the web page we were given and completing with time limit were fun.
Working in a group of three was very different, and I realized how important it was to respect, communicate and assign work when we were all stressed about finishing it before 4:59. Overall,I think working in a group of three was not that bad.
