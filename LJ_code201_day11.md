Day 11
I feel like today's lab assignment was another practice similar to salmon cookie stand. I used constructors and eventListener and eventHandler like last week's project. I am getting more familiar with the skills but still struggle alot sometimes. Really want to get i done before tomorrow morning so I dont get left one day behind every time ...
Still challenging!
