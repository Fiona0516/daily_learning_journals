Day12
Brian's CSS layout was very helpful. I remembered in last month's class, he gave this talk in the first week. That time I had no idea how important the basics of layout and how annoying it was to actually deal with css layout. This time, he gave the talk in third week when most of us have already struggled with css in previous projects. I found it extra helpful to learn this after going through the problems by myself.

Sam slowly went over yesterday's assignment and it was helpful too. I was glad that my own code actually worked and I was very close to what we should have. It was already 4pm when I started today's assignment. Still trying to know how chart.js works...so my code is still in the beginning stage.
