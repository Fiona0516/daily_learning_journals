Day13
Learned a lot from Brian's section again. He made the css layout very simple. And I have learned that the way we structure HTML greatly affects the accessibility and controllability to css.
I was excited to start today's lab this afternoon because I finally caught up with the class. Just until Annaka found out my chart didnt match the tally results, I realized I needed to get it fixed or I could not start today's lab at all... Hopefully I can figure sth out later tonight!
