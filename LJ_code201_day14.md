Day 14
Learned a lot of CSS styling today, which was very useful to the lab when we worked on making the PREVIEW.tiff
Britney and I only focused on making the very top part of the page. We did the markup first and began to style the part. It looked as what we expected but somehow we messed it up (dont know why ...). We gave up on that and decided to practice more on git flow.
I'm very glad to work with Britt and Britney. Especially Britt is very patience to explain everything to both of us. We also discussed about the project we want to work on. Looking forward to working with them next week.
