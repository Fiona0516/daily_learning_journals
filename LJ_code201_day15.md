Day 15
We got to see 301 presentations and preview the course structure today. Aaron also went over some advanced JS and clarified some tricky concepts. Later today we officially started our project. Our group came up with the page design and how we wanted the draft game functionality pretty quickly. Since we are not allowed to code until Monday, we sort of assign other works to do over the weekend. Ex:design logo, gather warriors' info, try different functionality on codepen, look previous 201 projects that are similar to ours....etc. I really like our working atmosphere. Each of us has different strengths and weaknesses and we figured out how to combine them in order to work sufficiently and happily in such a short period of time. Very excited!
