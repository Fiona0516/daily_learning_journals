Day16
First day of project week! Thanks to Britt for writing down some detailed goals and plans for the following days. We all watched the js online tutorial,designed our logo, practiced some coding on codepen, gathered information from classmates over the weekend. So today, it turned out we proceeded pretty fast to put everything together. The basic page structure and page design were pretty much set before lunch. Then we worked on putting data and filtering functions.
Overall, I enjoy working with Britt and Britney!
