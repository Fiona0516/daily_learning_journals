Day17
Second day of project week. So far so good. We didnt finish all the goals for today but we made a lot progress. We started from where we left yesterday by adding draftees' info and images, making some minor changes to the filters. Later mostly worked on js.
Overall, our group is getting along pretty well. I am glad to work with Britney and Britt. I learned alot from both of them not just only coding. Looking forward to accomplish this project together and present our hard work on Friday.
