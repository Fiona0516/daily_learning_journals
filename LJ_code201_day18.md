Day18
Today was another JS heavy day. Very stressful. I worked with Britt in the morning and we asked Munir for help around noon. Later I worked on the landing page and the about page. Everything was getting closer to what we expected. And the functionality part of the draft and team page was getting more progress too. Hopefully we will get it done and have user testing tomorrow.
