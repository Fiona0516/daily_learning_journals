Day 19
It was a challenging day.I started with responsive page and had it finally kind of work after Brian's help. Later Britney and I fixed and added the parts we could besides the draft page. We went to the classroom to see how our site looked like on the large screen in order to see if any changes was needed.
Later today I worked on the credit page which we just decided to add it today.
We are planning to meet at 8am tomorrow to pull everything together, deploy, and practice presentation.
