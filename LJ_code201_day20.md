Day20-- Last day of code201!
It has finally come to the end. The month has definitely been one of the most unforgettable and challenging days of my life. From none coding experience to stepping into this coding world, it has changed the way I see the sites that I view everyday, and even more respect to professional web developers. This is definitely not an easy thing especially from "zero to one". In this past month, there were many things going on. Moving to a new city, getting used to the bad traffic every morning and evening, having stress for not catching up with the class, experiencing cultural differences, and adjusting how to get along with people who have worked for years in the field not university. I have not only learned coding, but also so many other things from all these and most importantly, the people here. I am glad I decided to stay in this 201. The class environment was much friendly and understanding. Really hope we can all stay in touch in the future!
